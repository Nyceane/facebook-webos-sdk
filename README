This is a a guide how to connect to Facebook on WebOS platform.

I have been trying to get Facebook Connect working on WebOS and having no luck of googling the answer, so I've decided to build it myself.
Below are the steps you need to get it working
Step 1
Create a facebook app at http://www.facebook.com/developers/createapp.php
 Step 2
Setting up the website to your domain, in my case would be www.paschar.com, but you need to set it to anything that suites you
Step 3
Create your callback url on your website, which can be any url, in my case it's www(.)paschar(.)com/webos/callback.  Set it automatically redirect to following authorizing url upon receiving "code" in the QueryString
https: // graph. facebook. com/oauth/access_token?client_id=[your clientid]&redirect_uri=[your redirect url, i use the same one]&client_secret=[your client secret]&code=[the code you receive form querystring]
Step 4
Now that everything you need outside of WebOS is done, you can download this "facebook webos sdk"

For the entire guide, please visit blog post at http://blog.paschar.com/post/2011/02/08/Facebook-Connect-SDK-for-WebOS.aspx
